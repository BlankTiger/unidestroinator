## Unidestroinator

This app is intended to aid in the days of remote learning. Basically the need for it came from the fact that environment has pushed students' attention span to the absolute lowest. Quick solution to this issue was just to remove the part where you have to be continuously focused, thus aiming at the obvious solution of recording lectures.
